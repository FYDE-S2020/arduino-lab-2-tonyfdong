## Questions

1. What is the purpose of an IP address?

    An IP address hosts or networks interface identification and location addressing.

2. What is a DNS? What are the benefits of using domain names instead of IP addresses?

    A DNS is a Domain Name System, which resolves a domain name into an IP address. By using domain names, it is easier for people to memorize. For example, it is easier to remember www.google.com than an IP address.

3. What is the difference between a static IP and a dynamic IP?

    Like their literal meanings, while a static IP does not change, a dynamic IP changes over time.

4. What is the tradeoff between UDP and TCP protocols?

    While TCP incurs latency, it does not miss data.
    While UDP does not incur latency, it misses data.

5. Why can't we use the delay function with Blynk?

    Because while delay function is being implemented, no other functions can be performed.

6. What does it mean for a function to be "Blocking"?

    A blocking function waits for certain inputs to be triggered and then continues, just like the process for checking KBSR in EE 306.

7. Why are interrupts useful for writing Non-Blocking code?

    By enabling interrupts, the main function will run without stopping unitl certain inputs are triggered.

8. What is the difference between interface and implementation? Why is it important?

   Interface is the process that defines the capabilities of a function we want to perform.
   Implementation is the algorithm that actually does the calculation.
   Interface has to go before implementation: If interface is not set up properly, implementation will not work.
